cvfeatures
==========

image/video feature extraction toolkit, using OpenCV
read input image/video or directory containing many images
output json of various features

TODOs
=====
concatenating the json output 

=====
test.sh -- test script, also see here for example use
./imgs -- a number of test imgs
./tmp -- where the test outputs go, its content should not be committed to git
./src -- source code dir, cvfeatures.py is the main script
./apps -- application / utility scripts for processing data, not part of the core (reusable) tools
